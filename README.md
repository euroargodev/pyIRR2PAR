# Objectives and Background
The Photosynthetically Available Radiation (PAR) is a radiometric parameter that has been measured on floats since the beginning of the BGC mission. It is particularly important to estimate Primary Production or to help for Chla processing. This parameter was traditionally measured using the OCR504 radiometer and was typically associated with wavelengths:  380, 412, and 490 nm. In accordance with the recommendations approved during AST-24, this configuration was replaced by: 380, 443, 490, and 555 nm (without direct PAR measurement) due to new scientific applications and the potential ability to derive PAR measurements from the four measured wavelengths [Organelli_WG_Radiometry_AST24_20March2023.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HhDM9NZMGbhgXSlx_RA4Nooc2g_KlGUH/view?usp=sharing). 

The purpose of this Python code is to provide a wrapper for the two models evaluated within the Argo framework. It uses as input a matrix of four irradiance values at **380, 443, 490, and 555 nm**, along with the associated depth vector, and calculates the outputs of both models as well as the average of the calculated PAR values, which is the PAR estimate to be considered as recommended during ADMT26 [ADMT26-Leymarie-PAR Model.pptx](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1edo8Na_IFxEJGKgBwDNWRhW9zqafZP9W/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=112140535291181030156&rtpof=true&sd=true).

# How to use this package
JTan_PAR_results, JPitarch_PAR_results, mean_PAR, mean_uncertainty = IRR2PAR(Ed, depth)

Parameters:
    * Ed -- 2D array with columns [Ed380, Ed443, Ed490, Ed555] in W/m2/nm
    * z  -- depth

Returns:
    * Two lists: first for JTan_2025 results, second for JPitarch_2025 results,
    * mean_PAR : vector of the mean between mean_par and PAR (excluding NA/NaN values)
    * mean_uncertainty : vector of uncertainties
